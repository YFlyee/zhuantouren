  Chairman MAO once said: I am a revolutionary a brick, where need to move.

  `毛主席曾说：我是革命一块砖，哪里需要哪里搬。`
  
  Today, we as a new generation of successors. Revolution is no longer a brick, more like a brick in the society.
  
  `如今，我们作为新一代的接班人。不再是革命的一块砖，更像是社会的一块砖。`
  
  BrickMan say: I am a social a brick, where need to move. Yes, we have vagrants of these are social. We in order to achieve the dream job: some people drift in Beijing, some people drift in Shanghai, some people in guangzhou drift, some floating in shenzhen. In addition, there are some people, they in order to achieve the dream: actors in hengdian drift, drift in bfa.
  
  `砖头人说：我是社会一块砖，哪里需要哪里搬。没错，我们这些人就是社会上的漂泊者。我们为了实现就业梦想：有的人在北京漂，有的人在上海漂，有的人在广州漂，有的人在深圳漂。另外，还有一些人，他们为了实现演员梦想：而选择在横店漂，在北影漂。`
  
  We all know: drift, away, away from parents. Some people is to study, some people is to obtain employment, some people is to dream. This group of people, the heart is strong, is also weak. Heart is strong, because in their hearts determined choice, live and tenacity. Heart is weak, because they saw the neon lights in big cities, will want to home, I cried.

  `大家都知道：漂泊的人，背井离乡，远离父母。有的人是为了学业，有的人是为了就业，有的人是为了梦想。这群人，内心都是强大的，当然也是软弱的。内心强大，是因为他们内心坚定的选择，还有坚韧的活着。内心软弱，是因为他们看到大城市的霓虹灯，会想家，会落泪。`
  
  BrickMan: can we thought, for such a group of people wandering, build a community? Here, we share the wandering life; Here, we communicate with survival. We are from far apart, we wandering heart, also need a safe home. When we are helpless, there will be a stranger to give concern; When we're desperate, there will be a stranger to give guidance; When we are suffering, there will be a stranger to give comfort.
  
  `砖头人：我们在想，能不能为这样一群漂泊的人，建立一个社区？在这里，我们一起分享漂泊生活；在这里，我们一起交流生存法则。我们都来自天南海北，我们漂泊的心，也需要一个安稳的家。当我们无助的时候，会有陌生人给予关怀；当我们绝望的时候，会有陌生人给予指导；当我们痛苦的时候，会有陌生人给予安慰。`
  
  That year, we are displaced and come to big cities;
  
  `那一年，我们背井离乡，来到大城市；`
  
  That year, we stayed in the basement, also lived in partition;
  
  `那一年，我们住地下室，也住过隔断；`
  
  That year, we hit a wall around, has also been fired;
  
  `那一年，我们四处碰壁，也曾被开除；`
  
  That year, we have crowded bus, also through the subway;
  
  `那一年，我们挤过公交，也钻过地铁；`
  
  Today, we get together and feel at home;
  
  `现如今，我们聚在一起，有家的感觉；`
